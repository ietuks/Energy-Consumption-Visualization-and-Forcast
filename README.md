First, good work on the Data Science process. I think it's given our client a lot of confidence in how we'll get the work done.
Now that you've taken an initial look at the sub-metered household data, it's time to dive much deeper. I'd like you to begin by exploring 
some visualizations of the data and then to build predictive models that will demonstrate to our client how the data can be used to help a 
home owner to make decisions about altering power consumption. To provide immediate value, I'd also like you to provide the client with 
five business suggestions based on insights that you glean from your analysis.
Please package your recommendations as a PowerPoint presentation, again remembering that it is for a business, not a technical, audience. 
I'm looking forward to seeing your work. 

You are to perform an in-depth analysis of the power consumption dataset. You will accomplish this via data visualization and 
time series regression modeling. As a first step, you will learn the importance of granularity and how subset your data into meaningful 
time periods. Then you will explore the data using visualization techniques, and you will select the most information-laden visualizations 
to present eventually to your client. You will then develop three different time series regression models and work with seasonal 
and non-seasonal forecasting. Finally, you'll summarize your analysis and make recommendations in a final report to your client.

Your deliverable for this task will be a PowerPoint presentation aimed at a business, rather than technical, audience.
Task 2: Visualize and Analyze Energy Data
You have been asked to submit a PowerPoint presentation presenting your analysis of the energy consumption data that is appropriate to a business audience. Your presentation should include:

Step One Visualizations with Analysis. Minimum of 3 consisting of Day, Week and a time period of your choice.
Step Two Time Series Visualizations with Analysis. Minimum of 3 consisting of sub-meters 1, 2 and 3.
Step Three Linear Regression Forecast Visualizations with Analysis. Minimum of 3 consisting of sub-meters 1, 2 and 3. Also include the chart you built comparing the R2 and RMSE of each model.
Step Four Decomposition Visualizations with Analysis. Minimum of 3 consisting of sub-meters 1, 2 and 3. Also include the chart you built comparing the summary statistics for the seasonal, trend and remainder components from each decomposed object
Step Five Holt Winters Forecasting and Analysis. Minimum of 3 sets consisting of sub-meters 1, 2 and 3. Each set is composed from the forecast plot and plot containing only the forecasted area.
Any useful correlations or predictions you can glean from the data. If none can be found or if the relationships are weak, suggest other types of data you believe might be needed to improve the analysis
A summary statement that addresses the goal of this project. Has the goal been met? 
Five business recommendations you can suggest based on your visualization and analysis of the power consumption data. Include justifications of your recommendations
One or more slides discussing lessons learned.
Are there other things in the presentation to enhance your audience's understanding or to better support their business decision making?
